        <p>A little mouth, in fact, there are many problems!</p>
<p>Toothache, see the dentistry, bleeding gums to see the stomatology; then the face fell a hole, the chin dislocated… In fact, still see the dentistry! !<br><a id="more"></a><br>Now let me tell you about what diseases we have in the dental department. When you encounter oral problems, how to accurately hang into the appropriate department.</p>
<p>Although many general hospitals do not subdivide the stomatology department, regardless of the mouth or disease, they directly hang the dental department number, and there is no other choice. However, in some dental specialty hospitals, or some general hospitals, when the white patient first went to the registration hall (or opened the mobile app), and saw a dazzling array of “oral XX subjects”, it was easy to fill the question mark - how There are so many stomatology departments?</p>
<p>The division of stomatology, each region or each hospital has its own division plan. But overall, it is still similar.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a broader sub-discipline.</p>
<p>A. Department of Dentistry (tooth pulp, periodontology, mucosa)</p>
<p>Oral medicine can be said to be the largest department in the department of stomatology, and even the main body of the department of dentistry. Most diseases related to teeth, tissues around the teeth, and oral mucosa can be treated in the Department of Oral Medicine. Of course, oral medicine will be more subdivided in some hospitals, such as:</p>
<p>i Dental endodontics: mainly for the treatment of diseases of the teeth themselves. Such as rickets (ie fangs, fangs), pulpitis (inflammation of the teeth), periapical periodontitis, sensitive teeth, tooth defects… Of course, if the teeth are displaced or broken due to some trauma, the patient cannot be determined When you want to unplug it, you can go to the dental pulp department to see a doctor.</p>
<p>Ii Periodontal: Mainly for the treatment of diseases of the gums and tissues surrounding the teeth. Gingivitis and periodontitis are the most common cases encountered in the periodontology. Many patients with gum bleeding, loose teeth, pus, bad breath or gingival recession, root exposure can find suitable doctors and treatments in the periodontology department. Teeth cleaning is the most common treatment in periodontology.</p>
<p>Iii Mucosa: This is a relatively unpopular department. Of course, oral ulcers are the most common oral mucosal diseases, and other diseases such as lichen planus, oral leukoplakia, and herpes on the lips, etc., which occur in the mucous membranes (cheeks, tongues, and upper jaws) in the mouth and outside, can be preferentially found in the mucosa. Visiting a doctor. There are also some “difficult diseases”, such as feeling dry mouth, abnormal taste in the mouth, and pain in the tongue for no reason. These problems can also be seen in the mucosa department.</p>
<p>B. Oral surgery</p>
<p>Tooth extraction is the most common job in oral surgery clinics. If you need a tooth extraction for various reasons, you can find help in oral surgery. Of course, the most common is the wisdom of the teeth, and some hospitals even open the alveolar surgery to extract complex teeth.</p>
<p>In addition to tooth extraction, oral surgery is also responsible for many diseases that require surgery, such as oral cavity, salivary glands, cysts, tumors, and even oral cancer!</p>
<p>There are also small partners who have fractures of the face and chin because of trauma. If they need to be fixed, they should also go to oral surgery.</p>
<p>In addition to “diseases”, oral surgery is also responsible for some “icing on the cake” work - orthognathic surgery, such as “cutting the jaw”, so there are some hospitals in the dental surgery will also have a special cosmetic surgery specialist.</p>
<p>C. Department of Prosthodontics</p>
<p>As the name suggests, it is necessary to set the teeth in the missing area. At present, the main prosthetics department mainly engages in active dentures (including full-mouth dentures), fixed dentures (ceramic teeth, all-ceramic teeth, etc.) and dental implants. Some hospitals will also separate these departments, especially the dental implants. Because of the large demand, the “planting department” will be specially developed.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to grow your teeth, if you don’t find a special implant, you can go to the dental prosthetics department and you’re generally fine.</p>
<p>D. Orthodontics</p>
<p>This is a very popular section, especially during the holidays, it is hard to find a ticket. Because modern people have very high requirements for neat dentition, because of tooth decay, tooth crowding, etc., the partner who needs to correct the teeth can go to the orthodontic department.</p>
<p>E. Children’s Stomatology</p>
<p>This is very easy to understand, as long as it is infants and children (under 14 years old), it does not need to be because of toothache or other oral diseases, or just preventive treatment such as fluorosis, can be in children’s stomatology (also Called the “Prevention Division” to see a doctor.</p>
<p>F. Oral Comprehensive Department</p>
<p>If a hospital has a comprehensive oral department, it can handle most oral diseases except for incurable diseases. Therefore, when you can’t find a department that you can’t find, you can also treat it now. Simple, universal diseases can be treated directly. If you have a very professional disease, then you can save time and energy by diverting to various specialties. !</p>
<p>To sum up, the treatment areas of many departments will overlap, for example, especially a part of simple treatment, basic treatment, can be seen in all dental departments.</p>
