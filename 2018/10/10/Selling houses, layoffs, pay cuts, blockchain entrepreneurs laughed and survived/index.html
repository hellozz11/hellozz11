        <p>The shadow of defeat is shrouded over the blockchain. People are confused, lamented, and even fleeing, but no one records the entrepreneurs who are still sticking to the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>The past has passed, and the future is still far away. The only thing that can be grasped is the present.</p>
<p>The blockchain entrepreneurs still stationed in the bear market, they laughed and survived.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>In 2018, the global blockchain industry increased by more than 50%, and the industry’s compound annual growth rate reached 42.8%. The cryptocurrency based on smart contracts flooded into the market, and the market circulated nearly 1,700 cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In the nine years since its inception, the blockchain has burst out in this year and has fallen like a meteor.</p>
<p>Bitcoin plunged from a high of $18,000 to $6,400. The average break rate of the three exchanges was over 90%, and the high-rise buildings built by the bubble began to collapse.</p>
<p>The bear market is unexpected.</p>
<p>But we only saw the beauty of autumn leaves, but we could not see the gorgeousness of summer flowers.</p>
<p>The giants accompanying the cold winter, the half-year net profit of more than 700 million US dollars, the mainland submitted a prospectus on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the encryption mining industry has maintained a thousand-fold growth rate for four years, the global trading center of the fire currency landed in Hainan, the currency Ann started the blockchain charity foundation…</p>
<p>But more ordinary blockchain entrepreneurs, selling houses to pay their own employees, more ordinary blockchain practitioners, paying a lower salary to hold on to their own technology beliefs.</p>
<p>There is a lot of consensus in the blockchain world, and this consensus is to live.</p>
<h4 id="Selling-a-house-to-pay"><a href="#Selling-a-house-to-pay" class="headerlink" title="Selling a house to pay"></a>Selling a house to pay</h4><p>“The bear market is a good time to get on the bus. Blockchain is not a cusp, but a big trend that can be compared to the Internet.”</p>
<p>From 6 am to 12 midnight, Zhou Kai has been working for more than half a year. This high-intensity work rhythm seems to be somewhat out of tune compared to the cold currency of the currency.</p>
<p>The market circulated less than half of the funds. The company was on the verge of bankruptcy liquidation on several occasions. In order to maintain sufficient cash flow to maintain the company’s operation, Zhou Kai mortgaged the property and used the accumulated money for many years. The mount also cost one million. Tesla replaced the Audi with 150,000.</p>
<p>The block turnover rate in the blockchain industry is as high as 80%, but Zhou Kai has chosen to go against the trend.</p>
<p>“The bull market makes money, the bear market earns experience. The bear market is an opportunity for you to try your mistakes. The turnover rate is high. The company has more choices and recruits suitable candidates at a more reasonable price.”</p>
<p>In July and August, Bitcoin fell nearly two-thirds from the high point, and Ethereum fell below $200 in an unprecedented way. The whole industry was filled with panic. At this time, Zhou Kai entered the blockchain and started a wallet project.</p>
<p>In the early years, relying on being a mobile Internet software service provider, Zhou Kai earned the first pot of gold. In another friend who also works as a B-end service, he has to cut down all the business related to the blockchain. Zhou Kai has chosen to stick to it.</p>
<p>Every industry will experience a process from appearance to touting, from the bursting of the bubble to the reorganization of the peak. Bear markets or early markets need to be more trial-and-error, and adjust their rhythm at any time based on market reactions. If you make a mistake in the bull market, it will be difficult to turn over.</p>
<p>The most important thing is the initial heart. “If you only want to get a wave of money, love Western Europe is not faster, why bother to spend a few months to bite the product.”</p>
<p>Did not eat half of the meal, Zhou Kai received a call from the product manager, did not hesitate, he put down the chopsticks in his hands and rushed to the R &amp; D department, as usual.</p>
<h4 id="Bull-market-such-as-salary-reduction"><a href="#Bull-market-such-as-salary-reduction" class="headerlink" title="Bull market, such as salary reduction"></a>Bull market, such as salary reduction</h4><p>“The real thing you need to do is to be able to withstand loneliness, not to shuffle, and there is no future in the blockchain.”</p>
<p>At night, there was a pattering rain on the streets of Shanghai. The raindrops that fell on the windows were like numerous irritated nerves, arranged in disorder.</p>
<p>The blockchain media person Abin stood in front of the company’s floor-to-ceiling windows to annihilate the third cigarette butt, but the face’s grace did not dissipate.</p>
<p>There is pressure in the air, and no one cares about his current situation at night when the street lights are lit up.</p>
<p>For a long while, Abin said with some hoarseness: “It doesn’t matter, even if the business volume has declined, I still believe in the future.” When he said this, Abin just mortgaged the property and used it to pay employees.</p>
<p>“The blockchain media is similar to the speculative currency. Many people have seen the low-threshold business model of soft text, newsletter and explosive group to sharpen their heads and drill the whole industry.” The bear market is coming. Perhaps it is possible to clean up a large number of speculators.</p>
<p>Abin hand-held the black-rimmed glasses that fell quickly. On weekends, the office building did not have air conditioning. His face was already covered with sweat. Said, Abin slammed a few paper towels from the table, and opened his own WeChat.</p>
<p>“I often communicate with my peers in the media groups of some currency circles, and occasionally talk about some technical problems. But whenever this time, I will find that the topic of technology is not enough to talk about two or three sentences. Because few people have a deep understanding of the blockchain.”</p>
<p>The need to really make things is tolerant of loneliness. Without shuffling, there is no future for the blockchain.</p>
<p>At that time, it was already 11 o’clock in the night. Abin got up and went to the corner of the refrigerator to take out two bottles of beer and turned around and said: “I thought it was two months when I was studying this industry in February. I didn’t go out, I didn’t go out, I only studied. Industry knowledge, until a moment to see the dawn of the Token-pass economy model.</p>
<p>When I first entered the market, I was not impatient. I would have to leave the scene one day and I would be calm.</p>
<p>“pa”, Abin drank a full bottle of beer.</p>
<h4 id="Divorce-and-faith"><a href="#Divorce-and-faith" class="headerlink" title="Divorce and faith"></a>Divorce and faith</h4><p>“Growing coins is like doing business. If you want to make money, everything must be created by yourself. Waiting for something to happen, there will be no creation.”</p>
<p>“The global digital currency volume is about 900 billion US dollars, and it is only 300 billion US dollars. It is firmly optimistic about the digital currency market.” Su Zhe first learned about Bitcoin at a party with friends at the beginning of the 16th year. Mining is very novel.</p>
<p>At that time, he lived in Anningzhuang Road, Haidian District, and was separated from the Fire Coin Company by a road.</p>
<p>After pondering for two months, Su Zhe took out 10,000 pieces and tried to test the water. He did not think that he earned a small 100,000 in 6 months.</p>
<p>In contrast, Su Zhe’s friend at the dinner table was a bit sad. She came into contact with Bitcoin in 2009, and she is an old man in the currency circle. She has been ups and downs for so many years, but she has never been able to earn money. “Can’t hold it, throw it up by 4% and 50%, and the mentality is easy to collapse.”</p>
<p>The digital currency market fluctuated too much, and the wealth suddenly exploded and suddenly evaporated. Last year, when the supervision was introduced, the air currency project was ruined. Su Zhe, who had tasted the sweetness, was not spared. The good fortune seemed to be exhausted. This wave of bear market not only lost its cost, but also the red light of marriage.</p>
<p>“Wife wants to divorce me, my parents are also very puzzled about my speculation, thinking that I am engaged in pyramid schemes.”</p>
<p>The K-line chart that I don’t want to wear, the big bull market that I can’t wait for, sometimes even fall into self-contradictions and temptations, can’t help but start wondering: What exactly is mine?</p>
<p>“Fruit is like doing business. If you want to make money, you need to create it yourself. Waiting for something to happen, you can create it.” Su Zhe used his slightly obese body to pile up a Maitreya-like expression. Dudu’s fist is so cute that he can’t help but feel the magic that can’t question his words.</p>
<p>He is waiting, waiting for the comeback.</p>
<p>If one day, the miners who dig bitcoin shut down the mining machine, perhaps the eve of the collapse of the Bitcoin faith. But this day, like the end of the world in 2012, Imagine more than reality.</p>
<h4 id="Smile-and-live"><a href="#Smile-and-live" class="headerlink" title="Smile and live"></a>Smile and live</h4><p>“I don’t lose confidence in short-term fluctuations.”</p>
<p>Just after the trial period, I was notified that the salary was reduced by 30%. The old section was somewhat helpless. In the early autumn of Beijing, some were slightly cool, but the sun was a bit dazzling, and the old section of the swaying front was black.</p>
<p>“Fruit coins, p2p are quilted, and now all in the blockchain, or will buy some digital currency.” Financial background, graduate students into the investment bank after graduation, the old paragraph to understand, the old paragraph very early, Prosperous but paper is rich.</p>
<p>In the past two months, the economics of the blockchain industry has been declining, the number of layoffs, and articles on the turnover have been frequently screened, and the panic index has risen day by day. On August 15, the FT fell from 0.94USDT to 0.07USDT, falling below 93%.</p>
<p>The currency circle of the old days and the cold has also spread to the chain. A friend who is a public chain around the old section, the currency is not up, the cash flow breaks, the company directly goes bankrupt, and dozens of individual teams are scattered.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned old-fashioned year came to Beijing five years ago, and the yellow-plated Sifangjun green backpack witnessed his five migrations in the Imperial Capital. From the consulting company to the investment institution, to the incoming blockchain, every turn has been well thought out, but it has also brought some wrong.</p>
<p>The market was cold, and the investment projects that were seen before the old paragraph were put on hold. The company recently prepared for a micro-transformation, deeply involved in the investment project, and together with them to promote product progress, will also collect part of the cost, or token or cash, take some cash flow to maintain the company’s operation.</p>
<p>“I will not lose confidence in the blockchain because of short-term fluctuations.”</p>
<p>The colder the more you have to adjust your expectations, the layout is planned when everyone says it is bad, the future is planned, and when many people can’t say it, they will courageously decide to invest. When many people don’t wake up, invest in winter, all Excellent companies plan their layout in the winter, and prepare for the next step. When others see it, it is the success or failure of 5 years later, and the market share is just a glimpse.</p>
<p>If you are cold, you have to stick to it. The public remarks of Peking University economist Zhou Qiren became the creed of the old paragraph.</p>
<p>“Investment is like gambling. If you are in the middle of a bet, you will be in the sky. If you are wrong, you will be in the abyss.” The smoke is lingering. The old man took care of the gray suit and straightened his back and turned into the office building to welcome him. Another gamble.</p>
<p>The road that wants to overtake is blocked, and the new roadbed that needs to be opened is also present at the foot.</p>
<p>Those who are closest to the essence of things need more thinking.</p>
<p>New species that are enough to incite existing things will take more time.</p>
<p>The birth of the blockchain adds a lot of unpredictable weights to this era, and also gives people who follow it the wealth, freedom, blood, scars…</p>
<p>Do not abandon, do not give up, firm beliefs, immersed in deep cultivation, perhaps the most moving confession they gave to the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>Blockchain entrepreneurs, laughing and living.</p>
