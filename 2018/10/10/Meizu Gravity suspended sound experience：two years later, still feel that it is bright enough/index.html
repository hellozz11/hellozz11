        <p>The product that I shared with you today is special, because it has been two years since it was debuted. It is the Gravity suspension sound of Meizu. I don’t know how many readers remember it?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>In the field of consumer digital, two years is enough to change several generations of products, and once thought that Gravity will not be officially released, I did not expect it to come to everyone with Meizu 16 together. However, since it has already been released, this article will not discuss the story behind the Gravity ticket. We will start from the product itself to see what is special about this two-year-old sound.</p>
<h4 id="Timeless-design"><a href="#Timeless-design" class="headerlink" title="Timeless design"></a>Timeless design</h4><p>In the two-year period, the audio/speaker market has undergone great changes: smart products are everywhere, and giants such as Google and Apple have joined the army of home audio. However, we believe that Gravity’s design is not outdated, and it is still very special from the current point of view (especially under the backdrop of many cylindrical smart speakers), which is Gravity’s biggest product highlight.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Meizu Gravity suspended sound experience1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are already a lot of floating speakers on the market, but Gravity’s “suspension” is still different. Structurally, Gravity consists of a long cavity and a transparent prism (PMMA plexiglass). It is the addition of this prism that adds a “suspended” visual effect.</p>
<p>Specifically, the floating effect brought by Gravity can be divided into two parts. One is that the prism base has a feeling of hanging in the air because of the positional shift and the light refraction.</p>
<p>In addition, the upper part of the prism is actually a display screen, which can display information such as song information, album cover, etc., and its implementation is similar to that of Google Glass, which superimposes the display content and the real background (AR), so it seems that there will be a kind of The feeling of floating information. However, it is a pity that songs and album cover information can only be displayed when the Gravity app’s built-in audio is played, and only random line patterns can be displayed under AirPlay or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>According to the feedback from our small partners who are responsible for taking pictures, if you want the suspension effect to be more obvious, you need to find some angles to try. The background of the sound is best based on solid color. In addition, the power cord on the back should be hidden, or it will affect the visual effect (Gravity does not have a built-in battery).</p>
<p>All the buttons and interfaces of Gravity are placed on the back of the stereo, which can be a bit of a hassle to operate, but this design obviously also serves the look, because the entire speaker looks very simple in the viewing angle, there is no extra element (in Gravity The signature seen on the back comes from its designer Kosho Tsuboi). In summary, the addition of prisms has made Gravity and other long strips a clear distinction, although it has been two years, the appearance of Gravity is still bright enough.</p>
<h4 id="Less-built-in-resources-but-the-connection-is-flexible"><a href="#Less-built-in-resources-but-the-connection-is-flexible" class="headerlink" title="Less built-in resources, but the connection is flexible"></a>Less built-in resources, but the connection is flexible</h4><p>If you pay attention, you should have noticed that we have always called Gravity as the sound. The geek choice is usually distinguished as follows: if it can only be called a speaker through Bluetooth connection, it can be called a sound if it can be connected by Wi-Fi. Meizu official also called Gravity for sound).</p>
<p>Gravity’s pairing process went very smoothly, so give it a compliment here. It should be noted that the app used for Gravity pairing does not currently have an iOS version, so the iPhone partner will continue to wait and see; there is no connection to a 5GHz network.</p>
<p>Gravity supports Bluetooth, Aux-in and Wi-Fi input. The first two methods are familiar to everyone. Let’s focus on its Wi-Fi playback experience. The value of Wi-Fi audio is that it is not interrupted like Bluetooth when listening, and theoretically the sound quality is better than Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The official does not specify which source platform the Gravity pairing app is connected to, but from our actual experience, the library is still scarce (in addition, the app’s UI and interaction are not refined enough). However, Gravity also supports protocols such as AirPlay and QPlay, which can directly push the music on the mobile phone to the audio, which to some extent compensates for the short board with insufficient built-in resources.</p>
<p>On the paper parameters, Gravity is equipped with two 40mm full-range speakers and a rubber edge dual passive diaphragm, using TI’s digital power amplifier; from the actual sense of hearing, Gravity’s sound style is more neutral, tri-band comparison Balanced, with the Bose SoundLink Mini II as a contrast, Gravity sound is less heavy, with less mid-low frequency but more flexibility. Gravity doesn’t belong to the kind of “one ear” that sounds good, but it’s still more tolerant.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Gravity also supports Dirac Power Sound sound optimization technology, which is specially developed for small and micro speakers. After the measurement is turned on, the resolution of the sound and the sound field size are positively optimized. It is the sound performance of Gravity. Let’s have an egg on it.</p>
<p>The price of Gravity is 1099 yuan. If you pay attention to the layout of your home environment, I believe it will become a icing on the cake, and it is unique. Of course, this also means you have to pay for its external costs.</p>
<p>Because Wi-Fi stereo itself is a product that emphasizes family attributes, the design’s priority can be high. Gravity has a good design, and there is no drag on the sound quality. The product is logically feasible (and very promising). However, after Meizu wants to further enhance its product competitiveness, it may have to work harder on the “soft power” of app and built-in audio sources.</p>
