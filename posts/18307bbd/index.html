        <p>The US stock market suffered a sharp fall on October 10. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by around 800 points, the biggest drop since the collapse in early February. Due to rising US long-term interest rates and concerns about the slowdown in the world economy, high-tech stocks have been sold off, centering on funds that have bought a lot of high-tech stocks before, and have formed a situation of “selling and selling off.”<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>It is ironic that the rise in long-term interest rates brought about by the “strong US” that supports US stock prices is increasingly difficult to allow high stock prices to exist. High-tech stocks also face the risk of slowing down the economies of emerging market countries. “A strong America” ​​and “not optimistic outside the United States” supported “a single win in the US stock market.” However, this plunge show looks like a sign that the “US stock market wins alone” situation is about to end.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;It’s like an iceberg approaching in the distant darkness, and the Titanic, which is advancing at full speed, will soon be struck with it,” said Guggenheim Partners, the global chief investment officer of the US bond investment giant (Guggenheim Partners). CIO) Scott Minerd said on Twitter on the day the stock price declines.

This is a metaphor for &quot;the US economy is approaching the financial situation of the distant 2020 (Fiscal drag).&quot; At the same time, Minard sounded the alarm that in the context of &quot;a full-speed rate hike aimed at curbing inflation and overheating the labor market,&quot; it might hit the &quot;cliff&quot; of the economy.
</code></pre><p>Minard also issued a tweet in July, saying that “the stock price is in the final critical moment. Investors should now sell”, which is causing concern in the market. This warning was forgotten because of the subsequent higher share price, but today, with the upward trend of US long-term interest rates as the turning point and the collapse of the US share price, this risk seems to start to expand to the market as a whole.</p>
<p>In the context of the continued emergence of strong economic indicators in the US economy, the possibility of an accelerated rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board is once again recognized. Especially in the short-term financial and bond markets, the actions taken to continue the interest rate increase will be expanded.</p>
<p>The longer the term of the 10-year US Treasury bond, the more obvious the interest rate rises. This is because many people believe that the overheating of the US economy will eventually lead to inflationary pressures. Previously, future economic stalls have kept long-term interest rates low. Of course, the risk of stalling has not disappeared. The risk of inflation and the possibility of accelerated interest rate hikes are pushing up the level of long-term interest rates.</p>
<p>As a result, it is increasingly difficult for the US stock market to simply be pleased with the “strong US economy.” The rapid rise in interest rates is likely to hit the economy. On the one hand, funds have been concentrated on high-tech stocks that are expected to sustain growth at low interest rates, but if interest rates rise, the overestimation is hard to deny in terms of indicators that measure whether stock prices are appropriate.</p>
<pre><code>Federal Reserve Chairman Powell stressed that &quot;flexible response&quot; based on economic and price conditions. As the weight of the statement after the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is becoming shorter, it is reducing the hints of the future and strengthening the &quot;based on data&quot; posture. Josh Nye, an economist at RBC Capital Markets, points out that these changes &quot;slightly cause confusion among investors.&quot;

In the future, if there is a risk of economic stall, is it to stop raising interest rates as soon as possible? Still speeding up the rate hike? In the midst of confusion, long-term interest rates and stock price fluctuations tend to become fierce.
</code></pre><p>It’s not just the “internal worry” brought about by the strong US economy. There is also “external trouble” that cannot be ignored. Under the Sino-US trade friction, the risk of slowing down the Chinese economy is strengthening, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered the outlook for the growth rate of the world economy. On the 10th, from the morning, the selling of semiconductor stocks, which were considered economically sensitive, increased.</p>
<p>Due to the worries of China’s domestic demand slowdown, the share prices of consumer goods and luxury goods companies sold around the world fell significantly. Divan, who is involved in jewelry, fell more than 10%. Among the constituents of the Dow Jones index, the biggest decline was in sports goods company Nike (6.8%).</p>
