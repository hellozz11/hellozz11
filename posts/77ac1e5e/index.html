        <p>The market worried that US interest rates rose too fast, igniting US stocks on Wednesday, the four major indexes plummeted, and Dow Jones plunged 831 points or 3.2%, the biggest one-day drop since February 8, falling below the 50-day moving average of 25,995.09 points, but Hold the 200-day moving average.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>The technology-based Nasdaq index fell 4.1%, closing below the 200-day moving average of 7,4988.59; the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 4.5%, the S&amp;P 500 index fell 3.2%, even five black, the longest decline in 2016, the The index fell below the 50-day moving average at 2,879.39, but hovered above the 200-day moving average at 2,765.51.</p>
<p>US stocks plunged on Wednesday, causing US President Trump to jump. After the game, Trump pointed the head to the US Federal Reserve. The United States Association insisted on raising interest rates and was “already crazy.”</p>
<h4 id="Trump’s-Fed-insisted-on-raising-interest-rates-and-“has-gone-crazy”"><a href="#Trump’s-Fed-insisted-on-raising-interest-rates-and-“has-gone-crazy”" class="headerlink" title="Trump’s Fed insisted on raising interest rates and “has gone crazy”"></a>Trump’s Fed insisted on raising interest rates and “has gone crazy”</h4><p>Trump believes that the Fed made a mistake and the Fed is very tight. He thinks the Fed is crazy. Trump: “Actually, this is a US stock correction that we have been waiting for for a long time, but I don’t agree with the Fed’s approach.” Since the previous president basically did not comment on the direction of the central bank’s monetary policy, Trump often criticized the Fed for being rare in American history.</p>
<p>After the Fed raised interest rates three times this year, Trump spoke on the board, and the recent September rate hike caused criticism from Trump at the time. “He is worried that the Fed seems to be happy with the interest rate hike, but we can use money to do other things.” .</p>
<h4 id="US-stocks-hunt-red-October"><a href="#US-stocks-hunt-red-October" class="headerlink" title="US stocks hunt red October"></a>US stocks hunt red October</h4><p>The market is expected to raise interest rates in December. Regardless of how Trump jumped, the Fed seems to continue to raise interest rates slowly. It is still planned to raise interest rates by 4, 3 and 1 respectively in 2018, 2019 and 2020. And before, Fed Chairman Powell also pointed out that the Fed focused on the role of the central bank, not Trump tweets, nor political factors.</p>
<p>According to market data from Dow Jones, the Nasdaq index fell nearly 8% in the first eight trading days of the fourth quarter, which will be the worst start since the first three months of 2016 and also since 2008. The worst start in the fourth quarter since. The Dow Jones index fell 3.3%, which will reflect the worst start in the fourth quarter since the 22-year decline in the last three months of 2008.</p>
<p>From the season, October is a bad time for the market.</p>
<h4 id="Claymore-also-believes-that-the-Fed-is-raising-interest-rates-too-fast-which-is-the-culprit-of-the-US-stock-market-crash"><a href="#Claymore-also-believes-that-the-Fed-is-raising-interest-rates-too-fast-which-is-the-culprit-of-the-US-stock-market-crash" class="headerlink" title="Claymore also believes that the Fed is raising interest rates too fast, which is the culprit of the US stock market crash."></a>Claymore also believes that the Fed is raising interest rates too fast, which is the culprit of the US stock market crash.</h4><p>CNBC’s financial name Jim Cramer also believes that the culprit in the US stock market is Fed. “I really miss the former Fed Chairman Yellen.” He hopes the Fed can admit that “they raise interest rates too fast, too much”. Claymore said, “I don’t like what the Fed is doing, because the Fed has decided that, like the Fed Chairman Bernanke in 2005, we must stop this.”</p>
<p>Claymore’s well-known deeds are that in 2007, Fed officials expressed frustration with the signs of the upcoming financial crisis, and then in 2008, the financial tsunami caused by the collapse of Lehman. Claymore said that at present, interest rates are still relatively low, but if the interest rate is higher, we will start to see different impacts on the system. However, he does not think that 2018 is as bad as 2007, because Powell is easy to “recover fast.” The policy of raising interest rates.”</p>
<h4 id="Rapid-rise-in-interest-rates-brings-harm"><a href="#Rapid-rise-in-interest-rates-brings-harm" class="headerlink" title="Rapid rise in interest rates brings harm"></a>Rapid rise in interest rates brings harm</h4><p>In fact, the general rise in US interest rates is causing harm. As the price of public debt fell, the US Treasury yield rose to 3.2594% on the 9th, hitting a seven-year high, causing market anxiety that US corporate profit margins may be subject to higher labor costs and Compression of higher borrowing costs. Driven by the rise in public debt yields, the 30-year mortgage interest rate has risen above 5%, affecting the willingness of Americans to buy homes, and auto loans and other debt interest rates have also risen.</p>
<p>Charlie Ripley, strategist at Allianz Investment Management, said, “The US stock market sell-off on Wednesday was a panic reaction for investors, and finally realized that we were in a higher interest rate environment, and considering that stocks came to high levels, market investors are finding out the goods. Reasons. Higher interest rates usually lead to more severe financial conditions, which may inhibit future growth, and the stock market reacts.</p>
<p>The rapid increase in borrowing costs has also caused the four major technology stocks included in FAAN to be fully killed, which has dragged down technology stocks. Alphabet and Facebook fell more than 4%, and Amazon fell 6.2%, the worst day since February 2016, almost erasing all the gains of the past three months. Netflix shares fell 8.4%, the biggest one-day drop since July 19, 2016. After counting the decline on Wednesday, Amazon still has a 50% increase this year, and Netflix still has a 70% increase.</p>
<h4 id="Funds-retreat-from-rising-technology-stocks-to-value-stocks"><a href="#Funds-retreat-from-rising-technology-stocks-to-value-stocks" class="headerlink" title="Funds retreat from rising technology stocks to value stocks"></a>Funds retreat from rising technology stocks to value stocks</h4><p>In addition, some negative sentiments came from the financial police released by PPG on Monday. The paint and coatings company has increased the price of all auto equipment manufacturers by an average of 10% in response to rising raw materials. In this regard, Mouth Claymore said that PPG’s financial warning may indicate a weaker trend in the industrial and materials industries. These industries have been hit by fears of US-China trade conflicts. Trump’s threat on October 9 will be China’s additional 267 billion US dollars of goods will be subject to tariffs, which will add taxes to all Chinese imports.</p>
<p>Observers said that the killing of large technology stocks indicates that investors have begun to sell this year’s winners and transfer funds to other stocks.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that investors are shifting from a growth-driven strategy to a value-based stock, which has fallen out of favor as growth technology companies have soared. Before the recession, in the later stages of the economic cycle, investors often turned to neglected value companies.</p>
