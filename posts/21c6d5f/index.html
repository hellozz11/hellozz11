        <p>Before the beginning of this article, you need to share a book, “Recipes written in genes” (hereinafter referred to as “recipes”). In this book, author Gary Paul Nabhan tells a core point of view. Our recipes have evolved over thousands of years of food stress choices, and people in each region have recipes that suit them. There is no uniform healthy recipe in the world, and milk is the most representative food in this statement.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<h4 id="Speaking-from-the-milk-powder-that-was-sprinkled-on-the-baseball-field"><a href="#Speaking-from-the-milk-powder-that-was-sprinkled-on-the-baseball-field" class="headerlink" title="Speaking from the milk powder that was sprinkled on the baseball field"></a>Speaking from the milk powder that was sprinkled on the baseball field</h4><p>In the “recipes”, the author told us a story that is incredible. He helped Indian tribe friends to get free milk powder for low-income families, but these milk powders were not mixed with water to turn into sweet drinks, but instead turned into lime as a raw material for drawing white lines on baseball. That is to say, in the eyes of these Indian friends, the milk powder is not even useful for lime. It is really useless. Why not drink milk made from milk powder?</p>
<p>That’s because once these Indian friends drink milk, waiting for them is bloating, abdominal pain, and even severe diarrhea. It’s not protein, not bacteria, but lactose.</p>
<p>There are no milk and related products in the traditional recipes of Native American Indians.</p>
<p>Lactose is a disaccharide composed of a combination of a glucose molecule and a galactose molecule. Lactose is a particularly important energy substance in the recipes of newborn babies. The main nutrient in our breast milk that we subconsciously believe is protein, but in fact lactose is really important nutrition. Looking at the nutrients of breast milk, we will find that there are 7 grams of lactose in 100 milliliters of breast milk, and the protein is only 1.1 grams. This is also why human babies cannot directly accept milk because the protein content in milk is too high, and the protein in 100 ml of milk reaches 3.2 grams, which is not suitable for the human baby’s digestive system.</p>
<p>Lactose</p>
<p>However, for most people, breast milk is not a healthy food that comes to an end. In the stomach of normal babies, there is a large amount of lactase, which is under the action of this special protein, lactose is decomposed into glucose and galactose, which is absorbed and utilized by the body. However, as the child grows, the number and activity of lactase will become weaker and weaker after the age of three, and as a result, lactose cannot be effectively decomposed.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to say that there are still many foods that cannot be broken down by the human digestive system. For example, the polysaccharides in kelp and mushrooms are not absorbed by the intestines, and they become vegetables that “see tomorrow”. However, lactose is different from polysaccharides in kelp and mushrooms. Most of these substances become foods of intestinal bacteria. When lactose is decomposed by bacteria, a large amount of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane are generated, and a large amount of gas accumulates, causing abdominal distension, abdominal pain, etc. Symptoms, severe cases of intestinal cramps and diarrhea. This is what we usually call lactose intolerance. It may be a bit too much to say that the milk powder can have the life of an Indian friend, but the feeling of being inferior to death is indeed true.</p>
<p>This symptom is related to human genes in most cases. The LCT gene on human chromosome 2 is responsible for the synthesis of lactase. After adulthood, the activity of the gene is weakened, causing lactose intolerance. Human infants typically lose 90% of their lactose digestive capacity when they are 4 years old. It is particularly noteworthy that there are some extreme cases in which some babies are naturally intolerant to lactose and cannot even eat breast milk normally. They need lactose-free breast milk to feed.</p>
<p>In fact, the phenomenon of lactose intolerance is not uncommon in the world. In other words, the population that does not tolerate lactose is actually the majority. But the situation in different geographical groups is very different. For example, in East Asia, about 90% of adults have lactose intolerance, compared with 55% in the Balkans and less than 15% in Germany and the UK.</p>
<p>The distribution of lactose intolerance ratios in different regions of the world. It can be seen that the East Asian region is almost the least tolerant of lactose.</p>
<h4 id="Lactose-intolerance-is-a-means-for-mothers-to-protect-themselves"><a href="#Lactose-intolerance-is-a-means-for-mothers-to-protect-themselves" class="headerlink" title="Lactose intolerance is a means for mothers to protect themselves"></a>Lactose intolerance is a means for mothers to protect themselves</h4><p>This seems to be a joke that nature has made with us. Some friends may think that this is more like a defect in human life, but in fact, when humans evolve, lactose intolerance is probably a particularly effective way to promote reproduction. Strategy.</p>
<p>It is also an evolutionary strategy to prevent the baby from continuing to eat milk.</p>
<p>For mothers, using milk to raise infants can be a huge burden. What is more troublesome is that continuous breastfeeding will affect the next pregnancy and childbirth. This is undoubtedly full of risks under conditions of sound medical conditions. The behavior, so it is best to let the children take the initiative to give up breast milk. The severe discomfort caused by the closure of the lactase gene will cause the baby to stay away from breast milk, thus allowing the mother to have more energy into the task of giving birth to her younger siblings. This is a more reasonable explanation for the lactose intolerance.</p>
<p>So why is there still a human lactase gene activity that has been maintained, even after adulthood? How is the difference in the ratio of lactose intolerance among different populations formed?</p>
<h4 id="People-who-want-to-drink-milk-must-have-cows-first"><a href="#People-who-want-to-drink-milk-must-have-cows-first" class="headerlink" title="People who want to drink milk must have cows first."></a>People who want to drink milk must have cows first.</h4><p>On the surface, this is easy to explain, and human ancestors have the ability to continue to break down lactose. Most Europeans have the habit of drinking milk, but the Orientals do not have this tradition. Therefore, the Orientals do not need lactase, thus losing the ability to break down and absorb lactose in adulthood. This is the result of human beings being screened for food.</p>
<p>But the actual situation is not that simple. In the above point of view, we have overlooked a fact. Relative to the history of mankind, it is relatively late for humans to start obtaining milk on a large scale. Only after humans have carried out large-scale livestock farming, enough milk has appeared, which was about 10,000 years ago. Through molecular biology analysis, it is at this time that in Europe, small Asian sub-penins and North African nomads have genetic mutations, stable and long-lasting lactase expression, and with life.</p>
<p>It is a latecomer advantage to maintain lactase activity.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that those who can break down lactose can drink more milk and get more nutrients. Naturally, it is also good for leaving more offspring, so a person who can tolerate lactose develops a special behavior in a place where animal husbandry is developed. If we look at the map of the distribution of lactose intolerance, we will find that those who can effectively break down lactose are in a place where the livestock industry is developed and the milk supply is abundant. This makes it easy to explain why Westerners can drink milk as water, but East Asians like me do not enjoy pure milk in many cases.</p>
<h4 id="Will-lactase-be-activated-by-continuous-drinking"><a href="#Will-lactase-be-activated-by-continuous-drinking" class="headerlink" title="Will lactase be activated by continuous drinking?"></a>Will lactase be activated by continuous drinking?</h4><p>Some people say that after a period of continuous drinking of milk, the symptoms of lactose intolerance seem to be alleviated, and it can absorb milk nutrition. However, the ideal is full and the reality is very skinny. If lactose intolerance has already occurred, it indicates that the lactase gene has been turned off and it is difficult to resume work. This means saying goodbye to the food of pure milk.</p>
<p>As of today, we have no way to get the lactase gene that has been turned off to work, and of course we can’t make people who are lactose intolerant able to tolerate lactose. However, there are cases where the degree of lactose tolerance in humans is not static, but may vary depending on factors such as health status or pregnancy. For example, studies have shown that 44% of women who are lactose intolerant are able to tolerate lactose during pregnancy. A friend who claims to have accepted milk is, to a large extent, likely to be more tolerant, as if drinking more often, it would be more resistant to fainting than the original.</p>
<p>Yogurt and cheese are friendly to patients with lactose intolerance</p>
<p>If you are really lactose intolerant, don’t compete with pure milk. You can choose the relevant dairy products. For example, in the process of making and processing yoghurt and cheese, lactose will be decomposed or removed in large quantities, which makes it a good food for lactose to be intolerant to friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I still want to emphasize one thing, that is, there is no food in the world that is friendly to all, and there is no magic bullet. To find the right one for everyone, that is the best.</p>
