        <p>The Rooney Prize for Irish Literature has been held for 42 years. This is one of Ireland’s most prestigious literary awards, awarded annually by Trinity College Dublin to young creators under the age of 40 with a prize of €10,000. Past winners include the famous Irish writers Anne Enright and Frank McGuinness.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>This year’s winner, Caitriona Lally, only published a novel three years ago. The book was shortlisted for the Irish Book of the Year and was rated “wildly funny” by the New York Times Book Review.</p>
<p>This novel, called Eggshells, tells the story of a person who can’t fit into society and find friends. The protagonist Vivian thinks he is a low-energy child, wandering every day on the streets of Dublin, trying to find an entrance to another world.</p>
<p>The only thing that fascinates her is the street logo and vocabulary: she likes Dawson Street just because Dawson and damson (western plums) have only one letter difference; she insists on posting a tracing notice on the street to find a friend named Penelope, just to tell Her name is rhyming with antelope (antelope).</p>
<p>The description of Vivian’s daily life constitutes the main interest of this novel, like a self-sufficient self-satisfaction:</p>
<p>“I poured some aunt’s red wine in the mug. It tasted sweet and made people sleep. If it’s freezing again. Unfortunately, there is no ice in the refrigerator, I threw a few frozen peas in. Now it looks like a pool of dirty water. I sit down in a blue velvet armchair – It was the kind of chair that the policemen would sit after work, pouting and drinking, keeping the peas out of their lips. ”</p>
<p>But what attracts media attention is not the content of the novel, but another identity of Caitriona Lally: the cleaner at Trinity College Dublin in Dublin.</p>
<p>“The author is also a cleaner, she just got a famous literature award from her own university.” “This author also works as a janitor. She just won a prestigious literary prize from the university she cleans”, “Washington Post The title of the newspaper is written as such.</p>
<p>In the past three years, after getting up at 4:45 in the morning, Caitriona Lally had to put on a blue overalls and went to the college to finish the cleaning work from 6 to 9:30. After that, she will go home to take care of Alice, a daughter who is 1 year and 2 months old. At the moment of receiving the award call, Alice was losing her temper because she didn’t want to sleep.</p>
<p>“I know that the work I have chosen is a bit special for an author. But as long as the media description is accurate, I will not care too much. The only thing that disturbs me is that people who read the report may think that I am living. It’s very hard, or just because the job is humble, I feel that the award is enough inspirational. But the fact is, I have a full-time partner who allows me to spend most of my time writing at home and accompanying my daughter. I also went to college and worked hard. Labor is your choice,” Caitriona Lally said in an interview with qz.com.</p>
<p>After graduating from the English Literature Department at Trinity College Dublin in 2004, Caitriona Lally went to Japan to teach English for one year. In New York and Dublin, he worked as a lot of odd jobs and decided to go back to his alma mater for cleaning.</p>
<p>The inspiration for Eggshell is coming from the unemployment experience in 2011. She described to the Washington Post that she was looking for a job fair on the street, but she often found a job. After eating hundreds of closed doors, she gradually adapted to being rejected, but in her mind there was a prototype of Vivian, “a person who always wanted to have a connection and a sense of belonging with someone.”</p>
<p>After the novel was completed, Caitriona Lally obtained a contract with the publisher through a literary competition. However, in the year of the publication of Eggshell in 2015, she was unemployed again. This has also become an opportunity for her to return to school as a cleaner. The hourly salary of this job is similar to that of her writing, and it is also very stable.</p>
<p>“I tried full-time writing, writing while doing a job I didn’t like, writing while doing my favorite job, and finally I didn’t find a perfect answer. It’s the trickiest part of writing enough time and energy for writing. Every time I write In the last chapter, you have to watch Netflix to compensate yourself.” Caitriona Lally has written his second novel in this way.</p>
