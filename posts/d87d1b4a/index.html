        <p>Digital asset-backed stable currency, unsecured/algorithm-based stable currency can remove the need for third-party trust intermediary to some extent, and solve the centralized trust risk, but also the stability depends on the market value of cryptocurrency collateral. Market value floating risk, system stability and other issues.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers has participated in the issue of stable currency, and cooperated with Cred, a cryptocurrency lending platform, to jointly launch a stable currency linked to the US dollar. This is the first time that a well-known accounting firm has joined the stable currency issue.</p>
<p>Spring after spring, there are more than ten kinds of stable coins in a month.</p>
<p>Since the New York Financial Services Authority approved the issuance of GUSD and PAX stable currency by the US exchange Gemini and the blockchain startup Paxos on September 10, the encryption market has set off a stable currency boom. In September, 15 institutions launched 13 A kind of stable currency, most anchored in US dollars, also anchored offshore renminbi, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and gold.</p>
<p>Including, CITIC International Asset Management Co., Ltd. and Galaxy Digital Asset Management Co., Ltd. signed an agreement, and the issued assets of the company, WIT, anchored the offshore RMB when it was exchanged with Galaxy Asset Management.</p>
<p>The Swiss blockchain startup Eidoo also announced the launch of the euro-linked stable currency ekon. Xiong’an Technology announced the launch of a stable currency project linked to the yen. The Circle, supported by Goldman Sachs and Bitcoin, also officially released the stable currency USDC at the end of September.</p>
<p>The Australian digital currency exchange BitTrade announced that it will work with the blockchain employment platform Empparta to launch an Australian dollar-based stable currency in 2019. CollinStar Capital announced a partnership with Blockchain Global to launch the Australian dollar-linked stable currency AUDF in Australia in October.</p>
<p>The British London Block also announced plans to launch a new stable LBXPeg linked to the pound.</p>
<p>What is a stable currency? what is the benefit?</p>
<p>At present, the legal currency of each country does not have the global circulation attribute, and the transnational payment has the pain points of low efficiency, high cost, and intervention by third parties. To some extent, the cryptocurrency that can solve these pain points has the problem of unstable value.</p>
<p>The value of mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple is unstable, and there are frequent volatility, which not only hinders its application and circulation.</p>
<p>For the payment field, the stable currency is combined with the decentralized system of the encrypted payment network and a relatively stable price level, linked to certain stable assets, such as gold, dollars, etc., so that the monetary value of the unit price remains stable to a certain extent, There is great potential in the field of payments. By solving the payment problem, it can play a more important role in financial trade.</p>
<p>The recent report of the WTO on how the future of world trade: how digital technology changes global business points out that blockchain has the potential to change trade patterns and transactions, and fundamentally change the way financial institutions flow money.</p>
<p>For value stored value, investors are also looking for more stable encryption assets to store value, avoiding high risks such as excessive asset shrinkage due to value fluctuations.</p>
<p>At present, there are three main types of stable currency: 1. Statutory asset-backed stable currency; 2. Digital asset-backed stable currency; 3. Unsecured/algorithm-type stable currency.</p>
<p>Is the stable currency stable?</p>
<p>Of course, there are different opinions on the stable currency. At present, the total market value of the entire stable currency market does not exceed US$3 billion, which is less than 1% of the total market value of the cryptocurrency market. Among them, the USDT, which claims to be able to exchange 1:1 dollars, accounts for 90% of the stable currency market, with a total market capitalization of more than 2.8 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>The USDT is a legal asset-backed stable currency, which was officially issued by Tether in 2015. It can be said to be a precedent for stable currency, and it is also regarded as a transitional solution for the transformation of digital currency to real-world applications at this stage.</p>
<p>But Zhao Dong, an investor in the encryption market, believes that the success of the USDT is temporary. It gives up the independence of monetary policy with the aim of achieving high liquidity and anchoring the “stability” of the dollar. Other stable coins want to be independent and want to flow freely. In the end, they can only give up stability. The so-called “stabilized coins” naturally become false propositions.</p>
<p>Even if the temporarily successful USDT bears many questions, such as the opacity of the team information is still centralized, the USDT issuer Tether, as the centralized US dollar custodian, is questioned whether there is an equivalent US dollar on the ledger.</p>
<p>In March 2017, Wells Fargo freezed Bitfinex’s three bank accounts in Taiwan and stopped its dollar remittance business. In September, financial audit company Friedman LLP said it did not evaluate the bank account published by Tether and said the company In addition to the token and cash exchange business, the funds may also participate in other investment activities.</p>
<p>In November, Twitter users wrote that Bitfinex controlled bitcoin prices through USDT, and said that Tether had no evidence that USDT could indeed exchange 1:1 dollars.</p>
<p>As for doubts, Bitfinex and Tether first accused netizens of bad motives, and later Tether said that USDT may be supported by other digital currencies, not the US dollar. Bitfinex is facing further review. Recently, there have been rumors that Bitfinex is facing bankruptcy, but Bitfinex subsequently denied the rumor.</p>
<p>However, this series of people made people see that USDT’s information is opaque. What is the reason for the USDT circulation is to explain to the user that the user has no legal way to check the dollar amount of the Tether bank account, and it is impossible to know whether it is enough to pay.</p>
<p>Secondly, in Tether’s exemption clause, it is mentioned that it is exempt from liability for the payment of legal currency under any conditions, including when the company fails to liquidate. The crisis of trust brought about by centralization has not been resolved here at USDT.</p>
<p>Digital asset-backed stable currency, unsecured/algorithm-based stable currency can remove the need for third-party trust intermediary to some extent, and solve the centralized trust risk, but also the stability depends on the market value of cryptocurrency collateral. Market value floating risk, system stability and other issues.</p>
<p>Regardless of system design or circulation application, the road to stabilize the currency is long and long. Every progress and promotion needs to be doubled and promoted. I hope that each latecomer will not only benefit from the new market segment. And really can work hard to provide a stable solution.</p>
