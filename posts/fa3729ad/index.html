        <p>From October to November, the young people should pay attention to the subarachnoid hemorrhage.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>In addition to the evening of cerebral hemorrhage, there is another black time, which is about the New Year.</p>
<p>Because cerebral hemorrhage is not only a spike in the onset of the disease, it also changes with the seasons. This is a symptom of bleeding caused by high blood pressure in some blood vessel walls.</p>
<p>Among them, subarachnoid hemorrhage refers to a state in which one of the membranes covering the surface of the brain is bleeding under the arachnoid membrane. Most of the patients have symptoms of cerebral arterial swelling and rupture due to rupture of the cerebral aneurysm. Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs mostly in young people and is a dangerous disease with high mortality.</p>
<p>According to the observation of Japanese Suzuki Kazuo for 7 years, the number of cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage has decreased since June, and the high temperature from July to August is the least of the year. Then, from the beginning of September when the weather turns cooler, from October to November is the peak period of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral hemorrhage increases during the cold season from January to March.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that this is because of the cold winter, which causes the blood vessels to contract and the blood pressure to rise.</p>
<p>Reduce the temperature difference between outdoor and indoor</p>
<p>The solution is to keep warm. In the winter, you should pay special attention to it. You should spend more time thinking about reducing the temperature difference between the outdoor and the indoor.</p>
<p>Symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage are characterized by sudden and severe headaches, as if being beaten with a hammer, and accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and some people feel that the back neck is stiff. If there is a large amount of internal bleeding, it will soon lose consciousness.</p>
<p>If you feel a severe headache and lose consciousness after a headache, don’t hesitate to call someone around you. Call an ambulance immediately.</p>
<p>Some people only have mild symptoms at first, so if you feel that the usual headache is different, go to the hospital for specialist treatment.</p>
<p>Health tips</p>
<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage is less common in summer and often occurs between October and November. It should be fully warm.<br>In autumn and winter, if the temperature difference between outdoor and indoor is too large and blood pressure will rise, pay special attention.</p>
<p>In the spring and autumn, I have a tension headache, pay attention to the pressure and temperature difference.</p>
<p>Tension headaches occur in the cherry blossoms from March to April, and from October to November in the fall. It is generally believed that the reason is that during these periods, the highest temperature of the day and the minimum temperature from late night to early morning are too large. Temperature changes form a stimulus that strains the muscles.</p>
<p>Tension headaches are characterized by pain on both sides of the head or on the entire head, especially in the back of the head.</p>
<p>The sides of the head are like the ones that are tightened, feeling heavy and stuffy, often accompanied by a stiff or light stun of the neck and neck. Some people still feel vomiting, but they don’t really vomit. It hurts for 30 minutes and lasts for a week.</p>
<p>If the frequency of occurrence within a month is less than 15 days, it is classified as “recurrent episode-type headache”. If it is more than 15 days, it is a “chronic tension headache.”</p>
<p>Although the tension headache does not hurt people to work, it is still very hard to continue to work, and it will also create pressure. On the contrary, stress such as work can also cause tension headaches.</p>
<p>Stand up and do some slight stretching</p>
<p>The cause of tension headaches in the spring and autumn is that the stimulation of temperature changes causes muscle tension.</p>
<p>In terms of prevention, you can use air conditioning equipment as much as possible to keep the indoor temperature as constant.</p>
<p>In addition, when a tension headache occurs, sometimes you can relax your symptoms with a little exercise or a slight stretching exercise.</p>
<p>Even if it doesn’t hurt to work, it is sometimes caused by work stress, so you have to take time to relieve your body and mind and let yourself relax.</p>
<p>Health tips</p>
<p>People with stressful headaches are prone to worsening from March to April and from October to November.<br>Use air conditioners as much as possible to keep the room at a certain temperature.</p>
