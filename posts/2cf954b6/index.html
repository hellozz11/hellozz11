        <p>Google’s new product launch featured three devices, the Pixel 3 series, the Slate tablet, and the Google Home Hub Smart Home Control Center, as well as some gadgets.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>From the design of the product, we can see the intention of Google to compete with the old rivals Apple and Amazon. The pricing of the three products is very close to that of the similar products of the friendly merchants, and the main features also have many overlaps.</p>
<h4 id="Pixel-3-Pixel-3-XL-phone-more-expensive-than-iPhone-XR"><a href="#Pixel-3-Pixel-3-XL-phone-more-expensive-than-iPhone-XR" class="headerlink" title="Pixel 3/Pixel 3 XL phone more expensive than iPhone XR"></a>Pixel 3/Pixel 3 XL phone more expensive than iPhone XR</h4><p>Pixel 3’s product information was leaked before the release, and the new product released on Tuesday night was basically the same as the exposure information. The Pixel 3 is available in two sizes: the 5.5-inch standard model and the 6.3-inch XL model. Pixel 3 uses the same custom imaging chip as Apple to improve image quality on mobile phones. Both new Pixels are equipped with dual 8MP front-facing cameras, one for normal self-timer (f/1.8 lenses) and the other for wide-angle shooting (f/2.2 lenses).<br><img src="/images/Pixel phones, speakers with screens, and tablets, Google released a bunch of hardware products1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At the press conference, Google highlighted the Top Shot and Group Selfie Cam features of the phone. The former can automatically record a period of time before and after taking a photo, for the user to select a best picture, and can automatically add HDR+ to the replacement photo, which is more practical for a person who closes the eye when taking a picture. The latter is a group self-timer function, there is a zoom slider on the screen, which can bring multiple people into the lens at the same time.</p>
<p>In addition, the camera supports Motion Auto Focus auto-tracking focus, focus/blur intensity adjustment, Night Sight night view enhancement, and new Playground image sticker features.</p>
<p>In other configurations, the Pixel 3 series is equipped with an Opteron 845 chip, comes standard with 4GB of memory, and has 64GB/128GB storage specifications. Support Qi wireless charging.<br><img src="/images/Pixel phones, speakers with screens, and tablets, Google released a bunch of hardware products2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL are available in white, black and light pink. The Pixel 3 is priced at $799 (64GB) and $899 (128GB). The Pixel 3 XL is priced at $899 (64GB) and 999. US dollar (128GB). Starting October 18th, Verizon will be first listed in the US. From October 21st, it will be launched in 12 markets around the world.</p>
<p>Pricing for Pixel 3 is not cheap. The iPhone XR, which is just on sale, starts at $749 and the Pixel 3 costs $50 more.</p>
<h4 id="Removable-Pixel-Slate-tablet-that-automatically-switches-between-two-systems"><a href="#Removable-Pixel-Slate-tablet-that-automatically-switches-between-two-systems" class="headerlink" title="Removable Pixel Slate tablet that automatically switches between two systems"></a>Removable Pixel Slate tablet that automatically switches between two systems</h4><p>Pixel Slate is Google’s first 2-in-1 tablet device running Chrome OS with a 12.3-inch screen with a resolution of 3000 x 2000, front stereo speakers, 8 megapixel camera on the front and back, front There is a wide-angle lens for video chat and a battery life of 10 hours.</p>
<p>Ben Janofsky, senior product manager at Google, said at the press conference that Pixel Slate will meet both work and entertainment scenarios. It is also called “the first device on the market that is truly uncompromising.”<br><img src="/images/Pixel phones, speakers with screens, and tablets, Google released a bunch of hardware products3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Pixel Slate is equipped with a pluggable keyboard dock, attached to a notebook, and unpacked. One of the highlights is that the new keyboard features a round keycap with a typewriter style and a keystroke of only 1.2mm. The second highlight is that the keyboard base uses a magnetic tripod for multi-angle placement.</p>
<p>The Slate screen supports gesture touches and is also equipped with a stylus. The keyboard has a full touchpad, but it also supports connecting a mouse. Google designed a new Chrome OS system for Pixel Slate to run two different Chrome OS systems depending on whether the mouse and keyboard are connected. When you connect, you run the traditional style of Chrome OS, and when you disconnect, switch to the Android-style interface. Pixel Slate also supports Android apps.</p>
<p>In addition, Pixel Slate will offer a free 3 month YouTube TV. Users can watch live TV shows on their tablets.</p>
<p>The Pixel Slate is available in five versions. (4GB RAM, 32GB SSD, 8th generation Intel Celeron processor) for $599; (8GB RAM, 64GB SSD, 8th generation Intel Celeron processor) for $699; (8GB RAM, 64GB SSD, 8 generation Intel The CoreTMm3 processor is priced at $799; (8GB RAM, 128GB SSD, 8th generation Intel CoreTMi5 processor) is priced at $999; (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 8th generation Intel CoreTMi7 processor) is priced at $1,599. In addition, the matching keyboard costs $199 and the stylus Pixelbook Pen costs $99.</p>
<p>Pixel Slate will compete with the Surface Pro and iPad Pro series for the tablet market in the future. Currently, the Surface Pro 6 starts at $899 and the iPad Pro starts at $649. The Pixel Slate is priced between the two.</p>
<h4 id="Google-Home-Hub-like-an-Android-tablet-on-top-of-a-smart-speaker"><a href="#Google-Home-Hub-like-an-Android-tablet-on-top-of-a-smart-speaker" class="headerlink" title="Google Home Hub, like an Android tablet on top of a smart speaker"></a>Google Home Hub, like an Android tablet on top of a smart speaker</h4><p>Google Home Hub is Google’s next-generation smart home control center with built-in speakers and Google Assistant. In addition to the touch screen, it is equipped with a volume rocker and a physical switch for the audio Mic. Users can ask it to turn on the lights, lock the door, ask it about the weather, how long it takes to get to work, and anything else that you want to know from a search engine.</p>
<p>The device even supports YouTube video playback. To encourage users to experience this feature, Home Hub will also offer a free six-month YouTube premium benefit, including watching ad-free videos and listening to YouTube music.<br><img src="/images/Pixel phones, speakers with screens, and tablets, Google released a bunch of hardware products4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From the outside, it looks like an Android tablet on top of a smart speaker. Google said that Home Hub’s smart display has been helped by JBL, Lenovo and LG. It’s worth noting that Google removed Home Hub’s built-in camera to “make users feel more comfortable in their private spaces,” said Diya Jolly, vice president of product for Google.</p>
<p>The day before Google’s new product launch, Facebook also released a smart phone called Portal, whose camera recognizes and follows the human body. Facebook spent a lot of space on the design of the camera to protect user privacy.</p>
<p>The launch of Home Hub is clearly aimed at the rival Echo Show of Amazon. According to Rick Osterloh, Google’s hardware leader, Home Hub solved a design flaw in Echo Show 2 called backward firing sound.</p>
<p>In terms of price, the Home Hub, which omits the camera, is more cost-effective and sells for $149, which is cheaper than the $230 Echo Show.</p>
<h4 id="Google’s-wireless-charging-dock-Apple’s-Airpower-still-doesn’t-know-where-it-is"><a href="#Google’s-wireless-charging-dock-Apple’s-Airpower-still-doesn’t-know-where-it-is" class="headerlink" title="Google’s wireless charging dock, Apple’s Airpower still doesn’t know where it is."></a>Google’s wireless charging dock, Apple’s Airpower still doesn’t know where it is.</h4><p>Google has introduced a wireless charging dock called Pixel Stand that allows users to wirelessly charge in portrait or landscape orientation. At the same time, it can charge any Qi-compatible device.<br><img src="/images/Pixel phones, speakers with screens, and tablets, Google released a bunch of hardware products5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When the phone is docked on the Pixel Stand, it automatically displays the time, weather, calendar, and more for the phone. You can also automatically switch your phone to DND mode at night. The Pixel Stand is priced at $79.</p>
<p>Apple has also released a wireless charging pillow Airpower that has never been put on the shelf. Why is it that this product can’t be put on shelves is a mystery. A common guess is that Apple encountered difficulties that were difficult to overcome during the development process. If Google’s wireless charging dock is successfully put on the shelves, it will have the opportunity to be in the wireless charging field.</p>
<p>There is also a device that Google did not introduce at the press conference, but a product that was directly on the shelf - the Chromecast TV stick.</p>
<p>Third-generation Chromecasts support faster Wi-Fi connections and HDMI ports for TV insertion. However, it still cannot use the remote control and the user can control it via the mobile phone. The basic version costs $35, and the 4K-ready Chromecast Ultra version costs $69.</p>
