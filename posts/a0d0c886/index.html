        <p>Beginning next year, all primary school exams will be cancelled in the first and second grades of Singapore Primary School; students in the third, fifth and third grades of the primary school will be gradually exempted from the mid-year test within three years.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>At the same time, the transcripts of the primary and secondary schools will no longer show the students’ rankings in the class and the whole school; the disciplinary scoring cancels the decimal point and only takes the whole number; the “hanging” originally marked with underline or color on the year-end transcript will disappear. .</p>
<p>On September 28th, the Ministry of Education of Singapore (MOE) held a press conference announcing a series of reforms in order to improve the current over-emphasis on academic performance.<br><img src="Singapore&#39;s education reform, canceling the ranking of primary and secondary school students and a quarter of the exam.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A sample of secondary school transcripts and upcoming changes. From MOE</p>
<p>These initiatives are designed to alleviate the pressure on students and show the reflection and redefinition of the “learning” itself by the Singapore education sector.</p>
<p>An obvious change is that the digital standards used to measure student work levels are greatly weakened – for primary and secondary school students, teachers use “performance evaluation” to replace scores; while the remaining grades, although still in the exam, It is also encouraged not to compare with others, but to focus on their own progress.</p>
<p>The details of canceling the decimal point are also worth noting. The Ministry of Education believes that in the system of score-first, students and parents are stuck in the slight gap in performance and ignore the more important things.</p>
<p>The third and fifth grades of elementary school and the first and third grades of the middle school are transitional stages in the learning career for students in Singapore. The mid-year test is expected to free up three weeks for them to review and prepare for the exam. Accept new knowledge and course content.</p>
<p>This is part of Singapore’s new educational mission “Lifelong Learning”.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the Ministry of Education has carried out a series of reforms following this aim, from no longer announcing the PSLE ​​(Primary School Graduation Examination) champion list, to modifying the examination scoring system, and then to the nearest school exam. A significant reduction in the number – after this reform, about a quarter of the exams in primary and secondary schools will be exempted.</p>
<p>“In response to the challenges of this increasingly complex world, our students need to be lifelong learners.” The Ministry of Education said at the press conference that they hope that students will gain joy and greater motivation from the learning behavior itself.</p>
<p>Education Minister Wang Yikang said, “Overall, our teachers are on a high-speed train… running, evaluating, preparing for students… I think it is time to press the pause button.”</p>
<p>This is not an exaggeration. Singapore’s educational achievements have been highly regarded and ranked first in the latest PISA (International Education Ranking) assessment.</p>
<p>But what corresponds to it is the nerves of parents and teachers. Before graduating from elementary school, students in Singapore are going through two major exams. This includes the decisive significance of the PS6, which will determine whether students are assigned to special classes, fast classes, regular classes or general technical classes, and receive different levels of education.</p>
<p>The proportional allocation mechanism determines that this is essentially a competition with peers, and it also leads to the proliferation of extracurricular tutoring classes – everyone wants to work harder than others.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Singapore Ministry of Education announced a new PSLE ​​scoring mechanism, which came into effect in 2021. The new system will no longer be based on the performance of classmates to reduce bad competition, but criticism has not changed the principle of fractional supremacy.</p>
<p>“We are in a solid leading position and can make some concessions without damaging the results.” Wang Yikang mentioned Singapore’s international education rankings. He did not deny the effectiveness of the existing education system, but believed that the elements within the system needed to be re-weighted.</p>
<p>In 1998 and 2005, Singapore carried out two major rounds of major curriculum cuts, almost to the point where it could not be further reduced and did not affect the effectiveness of education. This is one of the reasons why the reform began to take the test results.</p>
<p>At the social level, people are also trying to get rid of the psychology that was once dominated by scores.</p>
<p>On September 27th, this year’s P6 exam PSLE ​​officially began. Five Singaporean parents launched a #LifeBeyondGrades campaign on social networking Instagram to encourage people to share their PSLE ​​scores online, indicating that this number does not define their next life.</p>
