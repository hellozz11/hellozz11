        <p>In the past, the academic transformation of Marx and Engels’s thoughts was generally expressed as “transition from idealism to materialism and from revolutionary democracy to communism.” When discussing such “two transformations”, I neglected that Marx and Engels had a clear and clear socialist democratic thought when they became communists. In fact, Marx and Engels inherited the outstanding achievements of ancient Greek and modern democratic thoughts and doctrines, formed socialist democratic thoughts in the process of transitioning from revolutionary democracy to communism, and created in the process of creating scientific socialism. Socialist democratic thought. The formation and establishment of Marx and Engels’ socialist democratic thoughts are of great significance to the entire scientific socialist theoretical system.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>The formation and creation of Marx and Engels’ socialist democratic thoughts have not been discussed as special topics in the previous writings on the history of the formation of Marx and Engels. The transformation of Marx and Engels’s thoughts is generally expressed as “transition from idealism to materialism and from revolutionary democracy to communism.” In discussing such “two transitions”, I ignored the struggle of Marx and Engels to actively engage in feudal autocracy, pay close attention to and constantly explore democracy. They did not stay, confined to the bourgeois political revolution and political liberation, that is, bourgeois democracy. Within the scope of this, but further proceeding from the proletarian liberation and human liberation, put forward a major issue of higher-form socialist democratic thoughts, and did not realize that when Marx and Engels became communists, they already had a clear and clear society. Democratic thinking. In order to overcome such deficiencies, this paper explores the faintness of the article, indicating that Marx and Engels have inherited the outstanding achievements of ancient Greek and modern democratic thoughts and doctrines, and formed socialist democratic thoughts in the process of transitioning from revolutionary democracy to communism. The process of scientific socialism has created the idea of ​​socialist democracy. The formation and establishment of Marx and Engels’ socialist democratic thoughts are of great significance to the entire scientific socialist theoretical system. Without the formation and creation of socialist democratic ideas, scientific socialism will lose its due value. This year marks the 200th anniversary of Marx’s birth. I wish to commemorate this article.</p>
<p>Like any previous theory, it must stand on the shoulders of predecessors, and can be created with the help of the ideas and materials of the predecessors. The socialist democratic thought of Marx and Engels also has a long theoretical origin. The socialist democratic thought of Marx and Engels mainly comes from the democratic theory of ancient Greece and Rome and the democratic thoughts bred by a large number of thinkers born during the European Renaissance and Enlightenment.</p>
<p>From the 14th to the 17th century, the ideological and cultural movement of the Renaissance began in Europe. The Renaissance, as its name suggests, is “the regeneration of Greek and Roman classical culture” and is dedicated to restoring the culture and art of ancient Greece and ancient Rome. In ancient Greece and Roman times, his literary and artistic achievements have made amazing achievements, and people are free to publish various academic ideas, which is in stark contrast to the dark medieval age of thousands of years. At that time, with the discovery of Greek and Roman ancient books hidden in the basement of the church, people were amazed at the ancient Greek and Roman literature and art, and began to vigorously promote and spread. Therefore, the first credit of the Renaissance is to reproduce and return the ancient Greek and Roman culture and art that have disappeared for a long time, including the ancient Greek and Roman democratic ideas. The Renaissance was a great turning point in the history of the development of human civilization, which liberated people from the demise of medieval Christian theology. Thus, the Enlightenment thinkers forged the ancient Greek and Roman democratic ideas into sharp weapons for the anti-feudal dictatorship and gave birth to the modern bourgeois democracy theory. As early as the youth, Marx and Engels had read the works of many political philosophers during the ancient Greek and Roman periods and during the European Renaissance and Enlightenment. See the work written by Marx and Engels from the second half of 1840 to the beginning of 1848. The political philosophers mentioned include: Solon, Christine, Pericles, Thucydides, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. De, Cicero, Machiavelli, Grotius, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Bentham, Gunsdown, Mill, Franklin, Paine and many more. Marx and Engels quoted these political philosophers in their writings, and some commented on their political views.</p>
<p>Marx spoke highly of the position of ancient Greece and Rome in the history of human civilization in his doctoral thesis “The Difference between Democritus’s Natural Philosophy and Epicurean’s Natural Philosophy.” He said: “Greece and Rome are the countries with extremely high ‘historical civilizations’ among the various nations of the ancient world. The inner period of Greece is the Pericles era, and the outer period is the Alexander era. In the Pericles era, the wise men Socrates, art and rhetoric, which are called philosophical incarnations, reject religion.” [1] Why did Marx admire ancient Greece and Rome, especially in ancient Greece? This is because democracy originated in Greek (demoskratein; its demos meant the people, kratein meant to rule), and the ancient Greek city-states produced great democracy. The Pericles era mentioned by Marx is the peak of the development of Greek democracy. From 443 BC to 429 BC, Pericles was elected as the chief general of Athens for 14 consecutive years. He was not only knowledgeable, civil and military, but also had outstanding speech eloquence. During the administration of Pericles, there were three main aspects of democratic measures: First, the establishment of a citizen assembly, the legislative assembly and the highest authority, gathered once every 10 days. Citizens attending the conference have a say. Anyone who makes a suggestion or criticizes to serve as a public official can make a final vote. Second, the establishment of the 500-member council, as a permanent body of the Citizens’ Congress, handles daily affairs during the intersessional period, handles wars and major events, has various administrative powers, and reviews the major issues submitted to the citizens’ assembly for discussion. Third, the jury court was established and became the highest judicial and supervisory body. It consisted of 6,000 people. 600 people were selected by lottery from 10 tribes. 5,000 of the 6,000 were the formal jurors of the jury court, and one thousand were Prepare a juror. Pericles’ reform measures made Athens’s democratic politics finally established and reached its peak. It was later called the “golden age” of Athens’ democratic politics. Its democratic theory and practice laid the foundation for the democratic political system in modern times. It is particularly commendable that Marx affirmed the sages of ancient Greece and Socrates because they resolutely denied religion. The wise, the professional teachers, are born to meet the needs of social democratic political activities. Democracy requires speeches and answers to various questions raised at various public gatherings. Therefore, the wise men recruit disciples and teach young people the eloquence and grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics of the debate. The wise men’s skepticism about natural philosophy, such as the famous wise man Protagora, advocates that “people are the yardstick for measuring everything” and fundamentally denies religious theology. The Athens government had expelled and burned his books because of his claim to atheism. Socrates was sentenced to death by the Athens court for insulting the gods of Athens and traditional religions. Religion is the stalker of freedom and democracy. The medieval religious rule of the millennium is the deadly enemy of freedom and democracy. Marx’s praise of the wise and Socrates’ anti-religion is a celebration of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>Marx and Engels paid special attention to the democratic theory of French enlightenment scholars in the 18th century. Their co-authored German Ideology has repeatedly talked about Rousseau, the enlightening thinker of bourgeois democracy. For example, the article points out:</p>
<p>“Sancho actually copied Rousseau almost verbatim below:</p>
<p>‘In order to reach an agreement, everyone should sacrifice some of their freedom, but the agreement is not for something universal or even for someone else. On the contrary, ‘I do so because it is selfish. Self-interest. If you talk about sacrifice, then what I sacrifice is something other than my power, that is, I have no sacrifice at all. [2]</p>
<p>… Sancho seems to have such an individuality, thinking that in the Rousseau’s doctrine, the individual contracted out of love for universal things, in fact Rousseau never thought of this. ”</p>
<p>“Sancho” and “St. Sancho” and “St. Max” are the nicknames of Max Steiner, the representative of the young Hegelian by Marx and Engels. Stirner’s “The One and Its Owners” advocates that all are self-interested, self-interest is the essence of self-consciousness, the driving force and truth of historical development. Therefore, the individual is the “single” of the world, the core and master of everything, and everything that binds the individual (I), such as the state, God, law, morality, truth, etc., should be abandoned. For the sake of the individual, “I” wants to treat everything as its own possession. Thus, Stirner emphasizes the absolute freedom of the individual and opposes the existence of all nations, organizations and disciplines. In order to prove his views, Stirner copied the Rousseau statement about the relationship between freedom and state. However, Marx and Engels pointed out that Stuttgart’s contractual thinking of Rousseau was “Rousseau never thought of it” and it was completely misinterpreted. Rousseau believes that “people are born free, but there is no shackles.” [3] This shackle is the state. It is unreasonable to have private ownership and the law of private ownership in the current state, and thus become the origin and foundation of human freedom and inequality. Rousseau has a famous saying: “Who first put a piece of land around and thought: This is mine, and people who find some very simple minds actually believe his words, who is the true founder of civilized society.” [4 To this end, Rousseau proposed the rational logic created by the state: the purpose of the state is to protect the personal and property of each member, and the state can only be the product of a free agreement of the free people. People establish a country by entering into a contract, and the state is a combination of people’s contracts. The contract is a joint individual who gives freedom to the country and freedom from the state. The individual (the people) does not sacrifice freedom. This is the question of the social contract to solve the relationship between the state and civil society. “It is the fundamental problem of the relationship between liberté individuele and pouvoir public”[5]. With such a convention and rights provisions, people’s freedom and equality are guaranteed. Rousseau’s core view of the social contract is that the people are the true masters of the country. In the “Social Contract Theory”, Rousseau first proposed the idea of ​​”natural rights and human rights” and “sovereignty in the people.” The sovereignty of the state lies in the people, and the government is only the trustee of the people and the executor of the law. If the government abuses public power and does not conform to the “public will” of the people, the people have the right to overthrow it. Rousseau has repeatedly warned people that it is necessary to prevent the government from usurping power and becoming an authoritarian government or to violate the will of sovereigns through the freedom of people’s assembly. This is both a protection and a constraint on the government. Rousseau also said that the people can use democratic elections to change the government and the rulers. Obviously, Rousseau’s social contract is to establish a “people’s sovereignty” country, and it is by no means what Steiner said to abandon all countries for the freedom of “the love of universal things”. Compared with the young Hegels, Marx and Engels have a more thorough understanding of the theoretical and progressive significance of Rousseau’s bourgeois democracy expressed through the social contract.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see through the above examples how Marx and Engels are familiar with ancient Greek and modern democratic thoughts and doctrines and have deep insights. They are the outstanding successors of democracy in the ancient Greek city-state democracy and the modern Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution. The reason why Marx and Engels can form and create socialist democratic thoughts is precisely because of such a long-term theoretical flow.</p>
<p>The socialist democratic thought of Marx and Engels not only has a long-term theoretical source, but more importantly, they are formed in the social and political activities in person and after arduous theoretical exploration.</p>
<p>In the 1930s and 1940s, when the British bourgeois revolution was completed, the French bourgeois revolution experienced a long and tortuous journey from the Bastille of the people of Paris on July 14, 1789 to the July 1830 revolution. 40 years of history. But Prussia at this time is still under the feudal autocracy. After graduating from Marx University, he directly participated in the social and political activities of anti-feudal autocracy.</p>
<p>Marx’s political activities began in February 1842, writing “Reviewing Prussian’s recent book inspection order”. Unlike previous studies, which focused on the field of philosophy, Marx’s commentary was the first political article. The issue of freedom of the press was an important part of the bourgeois-democratic movement’s struggle for political freedom. Kaiser Wilhelm IV refused to express his freedom of speech and stubbornly promoted cultural despotism, but in order to ease the contradiction, he made a gesture of deliberation. On December 24, 1841, a book inspection order was issued. This inspection order falsely blamed the inspection agency for excessively restricting writing activities, and instructed that the book inspection order of October 18, 1819 must be carefully implemented. In fact, the inspection of the second article in the 1819 rule stated that “the examination of the newspapers must not obstruct the serious and humble discussion of the truth”, “the writer should not be subject to unreasonable restrictions”, etc. Deprivation of the reactionary decree of freedom of speech and publication. It implies murder. With the pretext of “not serious” and “not humility”, it imposes “restrictions” on writers. Marx keenly saw the essence of the problem, and pierced the reactionary nature of the decree wrapped in hypocrisy with a spicy, bright, and profound tone. It was from the beginning of the book-receiving order that exposed the reaction, and Marx launched a fierce attack on the German monarchy and feudal forces. Marx demanded that the people be given freedom of speech, oppose the tendency of investigation, oppose punishing thoughts, and oppose the inspection of books and newspapers. The spearhead pointed to the autocratic government of Prussia and was filled with the spirit of revolutionary democracy. Different from simply earning the bourgeoisie’s own democratic rights, Marx began to stand on the people’s stand and defend the people’s right to criticize the feudal government. He believed that this is a moral country, that is, a democratic country should guarantee the people’s access to this. Political rights.<br>When Marx explained the people’s democratic rights to freedom of speech, he went deeper into the substantive issue of democracy. Beginning in April 1842, Marx wrote a series of articles on the debate of the Sixth Rhine Parliament held from May 23 to July 25, 1841. Marx’s first paper was directed at the provincial council’s debate on freedom of the press, entitled “The debate on freedom of the press and the publication of a record of the grade meeting.” Although the subject of the paper is about freedom of the press, it is no longer a simple repetition of the “Prussian recent book inspection order”, but a major development. This is why Marx raised the issue of the representative system of the people’s democracy. Representative system is an important form of bourgeois democracy. In 1806, Prussia was influenced by the French Enlightenment. Prime Minister Carl Stein began reforms. His measures included engaging citizens in politics to awaken their nationalist sentiments; releasing serfs; Local autonomy; reorganization of central government agencies, etc. Therefore, the provincial council of Prussia has the bud of bourgeois democracy. However, the Rheinland parliament, like other provincial councils, has only a very limited democratic advisory function, and is nominally composed of aristocrats, citizens, and peasant representatives. In fact, the aristocrats account for the majority of the provincial councils, defending them. Nature is the privilege of the landlord. Thus, with the freedom of the press as the starting point, Marx revealed that the hierarchical council of the Rhine province does not have true parliamentary democracy. It is even a retrogression compared to the old French parliamentary democracy. At that time, the representatives of the ranks of the Rhine Province did not really represent the people. “It is not the province that represents itself but the others who are surging, so that such representative organs will lose all meaning. If they are not represented by the principal, they will not be represented. “[6] Therefore, Marx sneered: “Here we see a strange situation that may reflect the essence of the provincial council, that is, rather than saying that the province must fight through its representatives, it is better to say that it must Struggle with these representatives.”[7] Marx’s critique of the hierarchical council exposes the opposition between the bourgeois parliament and the people’s democratic representative system, revealing the democratic rights including freedom of speech, and must be represented by the people’s democracy. To protect. The essence of democracy is the issue of state and polity. Marx broke through the concept of Hegelian idealism that at the time considered the monarchy to be the highest form and most reasonable system of the state, denying the future form of the bourgeois state, and advocated the implementation of true democracy. The country that is the country’s democratic representative system.</p>
<p>Further linking the issue of democracy to the state and realizing that it is necessary to solve the national problem in order to realize the people’s democracy is the third paper written by Marx on the debate on forest theft. In the age of Marx’s life, the so-called forest theft problem was greatly related to the material interests of the poor peasants of Germany at that time. Due to the bankruptcy of farmers and poverty in life, the problem of forest theft has become increasingly serious. In order to protect the interests of the exploiters, the state imposes severe punishments, and the provincial councils believe that the punitive measures are not strict enough to require the removal of dead branches as the scope of the theft of trees and legal sanctions. Marx’s illegal behavior against the landlord class was a fierce condemnation of Prussian state and law. Here, for the first time, Marx went beyond the spiritual realm and explored the issue of material interests. Marx firmly stands on the position of the working people and defends their material interests from political rights. He angrily rebuked the provincial council for brutally dealing with the poor, accusing the rulers of the privilege, and demanding that the working people retain the right to pick up the habits of the dead in the forest. However, Marx was keenly aware that the Pluto countries did not regard the violations of forest regulations as equal citizens and did not treat everyone equally. In fact, the Prussian state and the law serve all the main members of the forest. Marx pointed out that the state and the law have “become a slave to the owner of the forest…. It is the tool of the owner of the forest, so that the interests of the owner of the forest become the soul of the whole institution. All state organs should be the ears of the owner of the forest. , the purpose, the hand, the foot, for the interests of the forest owners to snoop, peep, value, guard, arrest and travel.” [8] Democracy is the country’s democracy, can not serve the rights of the people but only serve the country of the producers It is impossible to realize the representative system of people’s democracy.</p>
<p>If the “Debate on Forest Theft Law” is only a preliminary issue involving the state, then in the “Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Law” written by Marx in the summer and autumn of 1843, the national issue constitutes a central issue. The Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Law is an analysis of the national issues in Hegel’s Principles of Legal Philosophy, 261-313. Marx analyzed the “three powers” of royal power, administrative power, and legislative power, as well as the contradiction between monarchy and democracy, sovereignty of sovereignty, and sovereignty of the people. By opposing the feudal autocracy and criticizing bourgeois democracy, Marx formed the people’s democratic thought, and its core is the people’s sovereignty. Marx said in “Critique of Haig’s Philosophy of Law”: “In the democratic system, the state system itself only manifests itself as a kind of regulation, that is, the people’s self-regulation. In the monarchy, the people of the state system, in the democratic system, The national system of the people. Democracy is the unsolved mystery of all forms of state institutions.” [9] The fundamental difference between democracy and monarchy is that they represent “two completely opposing concepts of sovereignty” [10] One is the sovereignty of the people and the other is the sovereignty of the monarch. Marx firmly advocates the sovereignty of the people. He pointed out that “just as a religious creator, but a person who creates religion, it is not a state system that creates people, but a people who create a state system.” [11] Since the people created the state system, the people of course Have sovereignty. This sovereignty “in the democratic system, the state system, the law, the state itself, and the state is the political system, are only the people’s self-regulation and the people’s specific content.” [12] In fact, the people’s sovereignty is not Marx’s original. In the history of modern political thought, the British Locke and the French Rousseau are prominent representatives of the people’s sovereignty. They all advocate state power as a whole, and their highest sovereignty belongs to the people. “Sovereignty in the people” completely denied “sovereignty in the king” and thus became the theoretical banner of calling for the people’s revolution. However, the people in the modern society include the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The people’s sovereignty of Locke and Rousseau is only a bourgeoisie with property. The French Constitution of 1793, which best reflects their people’s sovereignty, is the case. In fact, there is no proletariat that represents the sovereignty of the people. Therefore, although the old people’s sovereignty thought nominally represents the entire people, it cannot be a theory that scientifically guides the proletariat and the working people to completely realize their political liberation and human liberation. The thought of the people’s sovereignty that Marx discussed is similar in form to Locke and Rousseau, but the people here refer to the proletariat and the working people.<br>After the proletariat and the working people became the core concepts in Marx’s people’s democracy and people’s sovereignty, Marx’s “On Jewish Issues” written on the fall and winter of 1843 deepened the study of the proletariat. At that time, the German bourgeois democracy movement began to rise. Jews are the most discriminated people in Germany, and more and more people are participating in discussions about Jewish liberation. Powell, a young Hegelian, described the issue of Jewish liberation and the liberation of the general population as a matter of religious liberation. When religion was abolished politically, it was possible to realize human political liberation and realize human liberation. Marx pointed out that Powell “has not discussed the relationship between political emancipation and human liberation. Therefore, the conditions he provides can only show that he has uncritically confused political liberation with universal human liberation.” [13] Marx believes that Seeking political liberation does not require abandoning religion. History has proved that the bourgeois revolution does not eliminate religion, but only realizes the separation of the state and religion and realizes the freedom of citizens’ religious beliefs. The bourgeois revolution can overthrow the feudal regime and the hierarchical system, so that the people can obtain political liberation in the case of religious belief. Therefore, political liberation only needs to abolish the feudal system, remove the restriction of property rights on the right to vote, earn bourgeois democracy, and implement the principles of bourgeois freedom, equality, and fraternity. Such “political liberation is certainly a big step forward.” “But it is not the last form of liberation of the average person” [14]. Marx pointed out that political liberation is only the bourgeoisie’s liberation and bourgeois democracy, and it does not solve the problem of proletarian liberation and human liberation. In the “Introduction to the Critique of Hegel’s Legal Philosophy” written in the same period, Marx made it clear that human liberation must have such a class. The liberation requirements of this class represent the requirements of the whole society to remove evil and remove obstacles to social progress. . In France, the struggle of the various stages has been on the stage of history, and the task of the liberator was finally handed over to the proletariat; in Germany, the task began with the proletariat “wearing a complete chain” [15], Germany must carry out a fundamental revolution. “The liberation of the Germans is the liberation of man. This liberating mind is philosophy, and its heart is the proletariat.”[16] This confirms that only the liberation of the proletariat can achieve human liberation. The liberation of the proletariat is the liberation of man. It must be led by the proletariat to revolutionize the people, establish a new democratic state, and realize the people’s democracy in accordance with the principle of the sovereignty of the people.</p>
<p>Compared with Marx, Engels faced social practice earlier. After dropping out of school in the year before the graduation of his school in 1837, Engels went to the firm to do business. When Engels was still in high school, he hated the autocracy of bureaucracy and bureaucracy. After entering the society, Engels participated in the youth German movement, opposed the feudal system, and advocated the use of revolutionary methods to overthrow the autocratic rule, which constituted the basic characteristics of Engels’ democratic thought.<br>At the end of 1942, when Engels came to Manchester, England, he witnessed the serious consequences of the rapid development of capitalism and personally contacted the proletariat, which truly represents the big industry, and contacted the workers’ movement for the first time. It is in the United Kingdom that Engels, by investigating social conditions, studying political economics and various socialist doctrines, wrote about “British views on the domestic crisis”, “Domestic crisis”, “The situation of the British working class” and “Letter from London”. The fundamental transformation of his democratic thinking began. Engels said: “The French Revolution is the rise of democracy in Europe. In my opinion, democracy, like any other kind of government, is ultimately contradictory, hypocritical, nothing more than a hypocrisy (we Germans call it Theology. Political freedom is false freedom, the worst slavery; it is the illusion of freedom, and thus the real slavery. The same is true of political equality. Therefore, democracy, like any other kind of government, will eventually be shattered; hypocrisy It cannot be sustained, and hidden contradictions must be exposed; either true slavery, that is, naked autocracy, or true freedom and true equality, that is, communism.” [17] Engels believes that Britain has recently The democratic system to be implemented in the future is “not the democratic system of the French Revolution that once opposed the monarchy and the feudal system, but the democratic system that opposes the middle class and property.” Social democracy.” He also pointed out: “Silent democracy can’t eliminate the scourge of society… This stage is just a transition. It is the last purely political means. This method has yet to be tested, and a new one will definitely develop. Elements, a principle that goes beyond all political affairs. This principle is the principle of socialism.” [18] Obviously, on the issue of democracy, Engels and Marx are completely identical, and they have gone beyond the narrow vision of bourgeois democracy. Denied the bourgeois democracy. Moreover, Engels made a more direct request from the local government, and must implement social democratic system, that is, socialist democracy.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Marx’s “On Jewish Issues”, “Introduction to Hegel’s Critical Philosophy of Law” and a series of works by Engels during the British period from November 1842 to June 1844, are recognized by the academic community. Marx and Engels completed the transition from idealism to materialism and from revolutionary democracy to communism. The process of “two transformations” is inextricably and organically linked to the socialist democratic thoughts of the people’s democratic system formed by Marx and Engels with the people’s sovereignty as the core.</p>
<p>In August 1844, Engels made a special trip to Paris to meet with Marx on his way back to Germany. This was a far-reaching historical meeting after they completed the “two transformations”. Through common discussions and mutual exchanges, they found that they understood each other’s understanding on all issues and decided to cooperate fully in theory and practice in the future. From this time to the publication of the Communist Manifesto in February 1848, Marx and Engels jointly began the creation of the scientific socialism doctrine. This process of creation is also the process of the founding of Marx and Engels’s socialist democratic thoughts.</p>
<p>The process of creating scientific socialism and creating socialist democratic thoughts by Marx and Engels are inseparable from the practical activities of creating communist political parties. From September 1844 to March 1845, Engels returned to his hometown of Rhineland, Germany, to inspect the situation of the local socialist movement and the workers’ movement, and at the same time extensively carried out socialist propaganda and organization work, and with many places. The socialist group established a connection. From July to August 1845, Marx and Engels made a special trip to the United Kingdom for an inspection. In the six-week trip, in addition to seriously studying the British economic literature and social life, they also in-depth study of the various struggles of the British working class, mainly the charter movement and the situation and experience of the Justice League in London. These investigations have accumulated rich materials for their theory of making scientific proletarian parties. The more in-depth study of the actual development of the workers’ movement, the more recognized that the various workers’ groups and organizations established in accordance with the principles of utopianism, petty-bourgeois democracy and sectarian separatism have become obstacles to the development of the workers’ movement. Armed with advanced scientific theories to form a revolutionary party, it is increasingly becoming a necessary condition for the healthy growth and smooth development of the workers’ movement. At the same time, the development of the political situation in Europe at that time showed that the new storm of the people’s revolution is about to come, and the proletariat must play a huge role in the climax of the revolution and must have its own independent political party. So from the beginning of 1846, Marx and Engels put the creation of a real proletarian party, the revolutionary communist party, on the work agenda.<br>When Marx and Engels created the communist party, they believed that they could not be separated from the workers’ movement and the existing workers’ party organizations. They would only isolate themselves and separate themselves from the working class. Instead, they should pass the workers. The transformation and formation of political party organizations into communist political parties can better play a guiding role in the workers’ movement. Marx and Engels believe that in the workers’ party organizations of Britain, France and Germany, the British charter movement was large in scale, but the charter organization was loose and chaotic, lacking a strong leadership core and unified struggle strategy; French conspirators Although the group has a long history and tradition, it has split very badly after repeated failures; the Justice League, which is mainly composed of German exiled workers, has a small organization but unites more advanced proletarians and absorbs some Non-German members have a more obvious international character, which is easy to spread new scientific theories to European countries. Therefore, they can become workers’ organizations that create communist parties. Moreover, several leaders of the Justice League, such as Chapel, Powell, and Moore, are true revolutionary proletarians. They have also had contacts with Marx and Engels, and they have invited Marx and Engels to join the organization. But Marx and Engels believe that they are still under the influence of various utopian socialist views. It is still too early to participate in this organization before the Justice League has accepted the theory of scientific socialism. In January 1847, the leaders of the Justice League became increasingly aware of the fallacy and weakness of the utopian socialist view and the correctness of Marx and Engels’ scientific socialist theory. Therefore, when the Justice League’s London headquarters was plenipotentiary Joseph Moore, When he went to Brussels and Paris to invite Marx and Engels to join the alliance again and expressed his willingness to accept Marx and Engels to reorganize the alliance, Marx and Engels readily agreed. Since then, Marx and Engels have begun to create the first proletarian communist party organization - the Communist Party’s party building practice.</p>
<p>Marx and Engels transformed the Justice League into a communist alliance, the first communist organization in the world. It mainly works from two aspects. First, it clarifies the guidance of the scientific socialism theory for the communist alliance. They co-authored the “Communist Manifesto” as the party’s program. The party program clarified the party’s nature, historical mission, struggle goal and struggle strategy, and stipulated that the struggle for and realization of democracy is the party’s purpose and task. Second, it is organized. The communist alliance guided the drafting of a charter full of democratic ideas and the practice of intra-party democracy, namely the “Communist Alliance Statutes”. The party constitution made the Communist Party a political party with a true socialist democratic nature and the correct practice of democratic rules. It is these two tasks that mark the completion of the creation of socialist democratic ideas by Marx and Engels.</p>
<p>In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels affirmed that “the bourgeoisie has played a very revolutionary role in history.” [19] The role of the bourgeois revolution is to destroy all feudal, patriarchal, and idyllic relationships. It has ruthlessly cut off all kinds of feudal shackles that bind people to natural dignity, denying feudal autocracy, bringing bourgeois democracy, and bourgeois democracy has progressive historical significance. Therefore, Marx and Engels believe that the Communists should join the bourgeois revolution as a prelude to the proletarian revolution. They have always advocated that the German Communists must actively participate in the bourgeois revolutionary movement against the autocratic system, become the most advanced detachment in the democratic revolutionary army against feudalism, and vigorously promote the complete victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution. Because if the bourgeoisie is the natural enemy of the proletariat, and only if this enemy is defeated by the Communist Party to gain political power, then the status quo of Germany is the greater enemy of the Communists. It straddles between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and hinders us. Combat the bourgeoisie. That is to say, the bourgeois-democratic revolution that transforms the status quo in Germany is the premise of the workers’ revolution. The party should skillfully act with the bourgeoisie to fight for constitution, suffrage, assembly freedom, and freedom of the press. Because of this, the Communist Manifesto states: “The Communists have focused their attention on Germany, because Germany is on the eve of the bourgeois revolution, because compared with the 17th century Britain and the 18th century France, Germany will Under the conditions of more advanced European civilization, with the much more developed proletariat to achieve this change, the German bourgeois revolution can only be the direct prelude to the proletarian revolution.” [20] However, the Communists should never The bourgeois revolution, as its ultimate goal, never stops its intention to attack the bourgeoisie. Instead, it uses the victory of the democratic revolution to gain more means for the proletariat to overthrow the bourgeoisie through the proletarian revolution. Therefore, the “Declaration” clearly states: “The first step of the workers’ revolution is to raise the proletariat into a ruling class and win democracy.” [21] After establishing his own country, the proletariat has won its own democracy. It is the real people’s democracy and socialist democracy. Communists must promote and develop socialist democracy.</p>
<p>The “Communist Alliance Charter” drafted by Marx and Engels is a vivid manifestation of the transformation of the Justice League into a democratic, proletarian party that implements intra-party democracy. Before the transformation, the Justice League, its charter has always retained the nature of conspiracy and semi-conspicsion. It obeys the old traditions of many guilds and sects. It is a political party that implements centralized and authoritarian leadership. It stipulates that the ally will be held to hold a series of mysterious rituals. The entrants will swear allegiance to the alliance. If the secrets of the alliance are revealed, they will resort to revenge. The alliance also sets too much power to easily lead the leaders to abuse their power. Centralized and arbitrarily organized organizations. These violations of democracy and centralized system of the Justice League are incompatible with the democratic parties that Marx and Engels advocated for democracy. This is one of the reasons why Marx and Engels are reluctant to join the organization. Now, the “Communist Alliance Charter” drafted by Marx and Engels is “completely clearing the charter of the conspiracy tradition and implementing the democratic organizational principles within the scope permitted by the conditions of illegal existence” [22].</p>
<p>The Constitution of the Communist League is a party constitution that fully embodies the nature of a socialist democratic party. Marx and Engels have made eight provisions for the practice of intra-party democracy: First, inner-party democracy is an inherent requirement of the party’s purpose. Because the purpose of the communist alliance is to overthrow the bourgeois regime, establish proletarian rule, eliminate the old capitalist society based on class opposition, and establish a new society without class and no private ownership. Such a new society must be a democratic society. The party that struggles for such an ideal society must be a democratic party. So Engels said that the communist alliance “the organization itself is completely democratic, … and everything is now carried out in such a democratic system.” [23] Second, intra-Party democracy is based on the equality of all party members. Article 3 of the statute stipulates that all members are equal, democracy is based on equality, and equality within the party means that every party member enjoys the same democratic rights and obligations. The third is to implement elections at all levels of the party organization. In this regard, Engels spoke highly of: “The committees are elected and ready to be removed, and this alone has blocked the path of any conspiracy dictatorship.” [24] The fourth is to implement the term system and the replacement system of the party. Fifth, regular meetings are held to discuss the affairs of the party, to speak freely, and to free speech within the party. Sixth, the principle of minority obeying the majority in the inner-party democracy. Seventh, the situation within the party is often reported. Eighth is to form a coordinated operation of the three powers of legislation, enforcement, and supervision. The Communist League divides the party’s power into legislative, executive, and supervisory powers. The district committees are the executive powers of the various branches of the region. The regional departments are the executive organs of the various ministries and departments of the province. The executive organ of power, the congress is the legislature of the League, and the highest authority of the alliance. Both the legislative power and the executive power have certain supervisory powers. The party’s legislative power is higher than the executive power, and the legislative authority’s supervisory power has the final right to decide on the appeal. The eight provisions of intra-party democracy formulated by Marx and Engels actually include the equal rights of party members, the election system at all levels, the annual meeting system of the party congress, the work reporting system, the information reporting system, the collective resolution system, the tenure system, and the replacement. The system of democracy, the system of supervision, the freedom of expression within the party, the right to appeal, and the like, have established a broad range of democratic institutions and democratic rights, thus constructing the theoretical form and institutional system of democracy within the party.</p>
<p>At this point, Marx and Engels’s socialist democratic thought has gone through the process from formation to final creation. The formation and creation of this idea can be expressed as follows: Marx and Engels, from the inheritance of the excellent democratic spirit and doctrine of humanity, fully recognize the progressive significance of bourgeois democracy in the struggle against feudal autocracy and affirm the constitution of the bourgeois state. The general, universally applicable democratic rights and forms that are prescribed. Marx and Engels exposed the essence and hypocrisy and defects of “natural rights and human rights” and “sovereignty in the people”. He pointed out that bourgeois democracy only fulfills the democratic rights of the bourgeoisie and does not realize the democratic rights of the proletariat and working people of the majority. This puts forward the people-centered theory of people’s sovereignty and the people’s democracy, which is a socialist democracy that is higher than the bourgeois democracy. After Marx and Engels formed such a socialist democratic thought, in the practice of creating a communist party, it is necessary to continue to advocate the development of socialist democracy after the victory of the proletarian revolution. This has become the party’s purpose and task, and must be within the Communist Party. Implement intra-party democracy.</p>
<p>What are the specific contents of Marx and Engels’ socialist democratic thoughts? Obviously, it contains two parts: people’s democracy (or social democracy) and inner-party democracy. Although Marx and Engels did not write a socialist constitution and a book devoted to people’s democracy, we can still learn about the content of people’s democracy from their relevant discourses in other works. In particular, Marx and Engels specifically discussed intra-party democracy. In fact, this is the performance of the people’s democracy they advocated within the party. It only appears in the form of the party. Therefore, if these party-formed democratic parties are replaced by the state. Form, it has become people’s democracy. According to this, it can be said that the content of Marx and Engels’ socialist democracy mainly refers to: in the new country where the proletariat gains political power, citizens (party members) have equal rights, enjoy freedom of speech, assembly, and association, and implement electoral system, representative system, and term system. , the replacement system and the supervision system.</p>
<p>The formation and establishment of Marx and Engels’ socialist democratic thoughts have unique value and profound significance for the creation of the scientific socialism doctrine. As we all know, the scientific socialism doctrine is based on the solid foundation of historical materialism. Historical materialism reveals that a certain social form is the economic foundation and the unity of the superstructure that productivity adapts to at a certain stage of development. The realization of socialism is the result of the contradictions between the productivity and production relations of capitalist society. The sum of the production relations constitutes the economic foundation, which is mainly the ownership of production materials, the productivity movement of capitalist society and the contradictory movement of production relations. It requires changing the private ownership of production materials as the public ownership of production materials, and the public ownership of production materials constitutes the economic foundation of the socialist countries. When it is clarified that the economic foundation of a socialist country is the public ownership of the means of production, it is necessary to further clarify what the political superstructure is compatible with. There is no doubt that this is the people’s democracy of the socialist countries. The scientific socialist doctrine should not only clarify that the economic foundation of the socialist country is public ownership of the means of production, but also that the political superstructure of the socialist country is the people’s democracy. Both are indispensable. If there is only public foundation of economic foundation and no democratic system of political superstructure, the scientific socialism doctrine is not strict and incomplete. Because of this, Engels highly affirmed the status of democracy in the scientific socialism doctrine. Engels proposed the concept of “communist democracy” and pointed out that democracy is “communism” and requires the proletarian party to “write the word ‘democracy’ on its own banner” and unite under the banner of “communist democracy” [25].</p>
